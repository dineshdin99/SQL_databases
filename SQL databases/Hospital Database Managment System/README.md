## Features
- Normalization of train scheduling data to eliminate redundancy.
- Calculation of maximum distances traveled by trains.
- Estimation of train punctuality (on-time vs. delayed).
- Analysis of average stop times at various stations.
- Insights into operational efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- SQL Server (or your preferred SQL database)
- SQL for database manipulation and analysis

## Database Schema
- **Trains Table**: Stores information about each train, including train number, source station name, and maximum distance traveled.
- **TrainSchedules Table**: Contains train schedules, including arrival and departure times, along with associated station codes and distances.
- **Stations Table**: Includes details about each station, such as station code and station name.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Railway-Database-Management-System.git
2.Set up your SQL environment.
3.Import the SQL scripts to create the necessary tables and populate them with data.

## Usage
-Run SQL queries to analyze train schedules and calculate on-time performance.
-Use the provided scripts to update and maintain the database as new train data is available.

# Results
The final analysis showed:

-Estimated punctuality of all trains, identifying those that were on time or delayed.
-Calculated the efficiency of on-time arrivals and departures, providing insights into potential improvements in railway operations.
